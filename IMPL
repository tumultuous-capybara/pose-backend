timing tokio task with an adjustable interval, defaulted to 1000ms
  checks signal streams every tick
  cleans up the expired access tokens in the db every so often

what should be mirrored in memory, and what's left to the database?
  having it all in-memory seems like the obvious solution, given how many random reads softcode will do to objects all over the system

how much caching for softcode execution, and how is that implemented?
